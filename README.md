# CS4171 Programming Assignment II
## Objective: 
EirGrid maintains data at 15-minute intervals on the nation’s electricity supply. 
The assignment is to generate plots of two sets of EirGrid data. The two files wind-gen.csv and 
system-demand.csv track, respectively, the wind generation contribution to total electricity 
generation – both what was actually generated and what was forecasted, and the system-wide electricity 
demand. All figures are in megawatts, MW.
## Your job: 
You should generate two plots of these two datasets and save them, as .png files,
respectively, wind-gen.png and system-demand.png. The first plot should be of the wind
data, showing both actual power generated and what was forecasted. Then you should 
generate a brand new heatmap figure using the actual power consumption data in 
system-demand.csv.
